A multimodal fusion sensitive information classification detection methodï¼šThis method uses Fasttext as a text-sensitive classification model .Then, InceptionV3 network based on deep learning is constructed as an image-sensitive classification model. Finally, a decision-level fusion algorithm is designed to fuse the sensitive classification results of text and images.
