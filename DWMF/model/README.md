# A Dynamic Weighted Multimodal Fusion Fake Information Detection Method

## Requirments
This code requires the following:
* Python>=3.6
* PyTorch>=1.7.0
* Numpy>=1.19.2

## Dataset
 **The method uses the open source disinformation dataset (MCG-FNeWS) using the Wise Source Institute - Institute of Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences. **
 
 ## Main ideas
** The model detects disinformation on social media by text, image, and summary features. A dynamic weighting approach is used to fuse the trimodal information to improve the efficiency of disinformation detection. **

## Experiment
** The superiority of this model is highlighted by comparing it with other advanced multimodal disinformation detection models. By comparing the unimodal model, the multimodal model can significantly improve the accuracy rate. Demonstrated by specific examples **
